Your network will have several convolutional layers followed by a fully-connected classification layer.

        "3. CNN performed better on the test set than MLP. The accuracy on test set for CNN is 87.49%, while for MLP it is 84.48%. The results show that CNN perform better in image classification.\n",
        "4. Since in this cases, classes were balanced, accuracy would be a good metric. But in case the metric is imbalanced, macro-precision, macro-recall, and accuracies for each class would be a better measure. This is because it takes the bias (if any) made by the model into account.\n",
